        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current freshmen at the University of Riverside in California. I have had plenty of work experience over the years, ranging from retail to externships. I have held many volunteer positions as well as some volunteer retail stores where I was able to learn a little bit about real life business. I have an older brother who is currently a senior at the University of Santa Barbara and he is studying Economics. It is good to have him as a resource because he has college experience as well as some understanding of the world of business. It is always good to have him to call if i run into any issues I may have. My dad has also been working in the field of business for over 30 years. He has worked his way  up the chain of management in order to get to where he is now. He is also a really good resource to have because he has plenty of real life experiences that can help me to learn more about business as a whole. Having these two people in my life has influenced me pretty heavily to get into business and follow in the footsteps of my dad.<br><br>

        I have had many great experiences in the business world such as doing a externship for a financial planning business last summer. It was a three week program where me and about ten other kids went through exercises, interviews, and lectures about their business, as well as talking to their employees and CEO. It was a great experience to get, and I was able to learn so much and network with many different people throughout the three week program. It all felt very official because I was required to dress and act as though I myself was an employee. In the beginning it was a very awkward and quiet group, just patiently listening. However by the end of the three week program me and the other kids were very close and open with each other which made the experience that much more meaningful. I learned about the many different parts of business from Operations to Human Resources and was able to speak to each of the heads of these programs. I was able to learn about how each program worked and the different roles people played within those programs.<br><br>

        I still have the pages and pages of notes that I took throughout the lectures regarding all of the important financing topics. Throughout the three weeks I learned so much about the business and was able to talk to lots of different people within the business itself. It was a great experience and further drove me into the world of business for college. I want to eventually work my way into management in the future but for now I am focused on passing my classes and looking for new internship opportunities that may arise. Learning Computer Science and coding is also a big interest of mine and while it is very difficult for me to work through and follow, I still find it fascinating and push through the many struggles I face.
